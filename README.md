## AlexNet

Implementation of the original AlexNet proposed on [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Krizhevsky](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf). I had to use a smaller dataset called CIFAR10 because I didn't have access to a GPU.
